# DSA_USING_PYTHON
Data Structures and Algorithems
Data structure is nothing but the organization of the data in such a manner that we can store data, retrive data, update data and remove data easily without any problem. 
DSA provides an appropriate way to optimise the data. 
Data structure can be broken down into two types, linear data structure and non linear data structure.
Linear data structure is something where data stored in a sequence, like array, stack, queue, deque, linked list etc 
Non linear data structure is just opposite of linear data structure where data does not stored in a sequence, like tree, graph, etc.
In this course, we are going to implement this DSA concept using python language.
